# Glossier's JavaScript styleguide
We are following [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com), with [some additional guidelines](#additional-guidelines). We are also extending the [react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react), [jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest), [eslint-plugin-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library), and [jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) ESLint plugins with the recommended configuration.

## Installation
```
yarn add --dev eslint@^4.19.1 @glossier/eslint-config-frontend
```

## Usage
To get started, extend Glossier's configuration in your `.eslintrc`.

```
{
  "extends": "@glossier"
}
```

That's it -- you can now lint your code.

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint .
```

## Additional Guidelines
As mentioned above, we are following [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com), with the following extra rules:

### max-len
We define a maximum line length of `100` characters.

```js
// bad
const books = ['JavaScript: The Good Parts', 'Eloquent JavaScript A Modrn Introduction to Programming']

// good
const books = [
  'JavaScript: The Good Parts',
  'Eloquent JavaScript A Modrn Introduction to Programming'
]
```

### prefer-const
Prefer using `const` over `let` or `var`.

```js
// bad
let a = 1

// good
const a = 1
```

### no-var
Prefer using `let` over `var`.

```js
// bad
var foo = 'bar'
foo = 'baz'

// good
let foo = 'bar'
foo = 'baz'
```
